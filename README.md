# tutor

A method for generating tutorial popups for web applications

## What is it?

An idea to help make web applications easier to learn to use. This will show you inline popups based on what page you're on. It needs to:

 - popups need to be marked as understood by either completing their action or tapping ok
 - display multiple popups at once and only progress once they've all been obeyed
 - there can be multiple tutorials
 - the progress can be paused, cancelled, or reset at any time
 - the popups should work on responsive designs

## Next steps

 - Bootstrap the demo
 - Jasmine tests
 - Finish doc blocks

## Future improvements

 - Make page scroll to tutorial box if not on display already
 - Add animations object
 - Add extra box flag so centralised box on small screen becomes catfish
